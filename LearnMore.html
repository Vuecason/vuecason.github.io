			<h1>3D printing was supposed to revolutionize the world. It hasn't.</h1>
			Vuecason is building a rapid metal 3d printer. A hassle-free metal 3d 			printer will allow for  hardware development to be  more like software development. AWS Lambda lets you scale up the same code with ease. Manufacturing could scale up the same way. Current metal addtive solutions, including binder jet metal printing, have too much post-processing to scale to mid-volume production. The Vuecason printer will print 100% metal, so no de-binding or sintering is needed. A part that previosly had a 7 day lead time will now have a lead time of one day.
