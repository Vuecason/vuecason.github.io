The consumption of machine tools is a strong indicator of the overall manufacturing capacity of a nation. The proliferation of machine tools, such as CNC machines enabled the increases in automation seen since the 1960's. To honor the history of machine tooling, Vuecason is named after Jacques de Vaucanson, inventor of the all-metal lathe in 1751. Prior to this, all-metal lathes only existed for watchmaking. These lathes were too small to make larger parts that enabled the industrial revolution. Larger lathes made from wood were unable to provide the precision to enable parts created during the industrial revolution. Without the all-metal lathe, James Watt's steam engine wouldn't exist. In a way the change in the functional use of lathes.

Optimizing to minimize print time at the cost of more intense post-processing actually increases lead times. The best way to print metals is like plastics. Metal AM isn't even good for prototyping if there is an intent to manufacture. An example: Tesla will not 3d print their chassis to prototype it. Metal AM needs to be fast enough to scale to low volume manufacturing. Then the same print methodology for protoyping can go direclty into manufacturing and the physical properties on either process align.
