'introduction'>Introduction</h1> \n                  Machine tools like lathes unlocked high precision for larger parts, enabling the creation of inventions such as the steam engine, ultimately giving birth to the industrial revolution.\n                  metal AM might become the ultimate machine tool, with more automation and flexibility than the past.  \n                  Additive manufacturing can serve as an abstraction layer for manufacturing, so design engineers spend less time thinking about manufacturing.\n                  Fast, reliable, and cost effective metal AM will allow for iteration in production, localized production, and more sophisticated parts.\n                  By printing metals like plastics, many issues of existing metal AM processes can be avoided. \n                  <Divider></Divider>\n                  <h1 variant = 'header'>Significance of machine tooling</h1>\n                  A machine tool is a machine that helps build machines and products\n                  machine tools are an important underlying part of any industrial society and enable the industrial capacity of any nation.  The consumption of machine tools is a strong indicator of the overall manufacturing capacity of a nation.\n                  The proliferation of machine tools, such as CNC machines enabled the increases in automation seen since the 1960's. \n                  To honor the history of machine tooling, Vuecason is named after Jacques de Vaucanson, inventor of the all-metal lathe in 1751. Prior to Vaucanson's lathe, all-metal lathes were only utilized for watchmaking. These lathes were too small to make the larger parts that enabled the industrial revolution. Larger lathes made from wood were unable to provide the precision either. Without the the large all-metal lathe, James Watt's steam engine wouldn't exist. In a way the change in the functional use of lathes isn't all that different from our goals. Current metal AM(primarily binder jet), is intended for precise, small parts - the Vuecason printer will unlock greater precision in larger parts.\n                  The fundemental question: How can we make it easier and faster to shape and place metal?\n                  <Divider></Divider>\n                  <h1>State of modern machining</h1>\n                  Modern manufacturing paradigms such as just in time manufacturing tradeoff resilience with efficiency. Production has become hyper-concentrated.\n                  Supply chains become vulnerable to disruptions from black swan events.\n                  Increased logistics overhead costs are a result of complex supply chains.\n                  A strong machine tooling industry has taken off in China, whereas countries such as Brazil and India are not able to sustain a strong machine tool industry.\n                  <Divider></Divider>\n                  <h1>Why additive manufacturing still sucks</h1>\n                  AM companies have optimized the wrong constraints. Optimizing to minimize print time at the cost of more intense post-processing actually increases lead times. The best way to print metals is like plastics. Metal AM isn't even good for prototyping if there is an intent to manufacture. An example: Tesla will not 3d print their chassis to prototype it. Metal AM needs to be fast enough to scale to low volume manufacturing. Then the same print methodology for protoyping can go direclty into manufacturing and the physical properties on either process align. Without that, AM is only good for one off prototyping.\n                  <Divider></Divider>\n                  <h1>What happened to the 3D printing revolution</h1>\n                  In 2015, Morgan Stanley forecasted additive manufacturing would be worth as high as $21.3 billion by 2020. Ark invest predicted the market would be valued at $41 billion in 2020.

The consumption of machine tools is a strong indicator of the overall manufacturing capacity of a nation.\n          The proliferation of machine tools, such as CNC machines enabled the increases in automation seen since the 1960's. \n          To honor the history of machine tooling, Vuecason is named after Jacques de Vaucanson, inventor of the all-metal lathe in 1751. Prior to Vaucanson's lathe, all-metal lathes were only utilized for watchmaking. These lathes were too small to make the larger parts that enabled the industrial revolution. Larger lathes made from wood were unable to provide the precision either. Without the the large all-metal lathe, James Watt's steam engine wouldn't exist. In a way the change in the functional use of lathes isn't all that different from our goals. Current metal AM(primarily binder jet), is intended for precise, small parts - the Vuecason printer will unlock greater precision in larger parts.\n          The fundemental question: How can we make it easier and faster to shape and place metal?\n          <Divider></Divider>\n          <h1>State of modern machining</h1>\n          Modern manufacturing paradigms such as just in time manufacturing tradeoff resilience with efficiency. Production has become hyper-concentrated.\n          Supply chains become vulnerable to disruptions from black swan events.\n          Increased logistics overhead costs are a result of complex supply chains.\n          A strong machine tooling industry has taken off in China, whereas countries such as Brazil and India are not able to sustain a strong machine tool industry.\n          <Divider></Divider>\n          <h1>Why additive manufacturing still sucks</h1>\n          AM companies have optimized the wrong constraints. Optimizing to minimize print time at the cost of more intense post-processing actually increases lead times. The best way to print metals is like plastics. Metal AM isn't even good for prototyping if there is an intent to manufacture. An example: Tesla will not 3d print their chassis to prototype it. Metal AM needs to be fast enough to scale to low volume manufacturing. Then the same print methodology for protoyping can go direclty into manufacturing and the physical properties on either process align. Without that, AM is only good for one off prototyping.\n          <Divider></Divider>\n          <h1>What happened to the 3D printing revolution</h1>\n          In 2015, Morgan Stanley forecasted additive manufacturing would be worth as high as $21.3 billion by 2020.
